\subsection*{SCENE 1}

\subsubsection*{WHEREIN LEELA IS FOUND AT THE ORPHANARIUM}

MR VOGEL

Who is this one-eyed female baby Moses?
With courage in her female baby smile.

ORPHANS

A savior from the stars.
Or something stranger still.

BABY LEELA

Or just a lonely filthy starving child!

\subsection*{Scene 2}

\subsubsection*{FIGHT WITH GODZILLA}

BENDER

Leela. Leela. Leela, save him.
Save Fry. Save Fry.
Godzilla will devour him.
As for me, I must be off
to have my doctor check this cough.
[cough] Goodbye.

\section*{Act 2}

\subsection*{Scene 1}

\subsubsection*{IN ROBOT HELL}

FRY

To win Leela's heart
with the Holophonor's art,
I need hands of transcendental quickness.

ROBOT DEVIL

Well, I don't see any danger
in gambling with a stranger.
For my head is of a most amazing thickness.
I'm stupid, I'm stupid
I'm stupider than you.
I'm stupider than you in every way.

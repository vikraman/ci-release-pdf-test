\subsection*{SCENE 1}

\subsubsection*{WHEREIN LEELA IS FOUND AT THE ORPHANARIUM}

MR VOGEL

Who is this one-eyed female baby Moses?
With courage in her female baby smile.

ORPHANS

A savior from the stars.
Or something stranger still.

BABY LEELA

Or just a lonely filthy starving child!

\subsection*{Scene 2}

\subsubsection*{FIGHT WITH GODZILLA}

BENDER

Leela. Leela. Leela, save him.
Save Fry. Save Fry.
Godzilla will devour him.
As for me, I must be off
to have my doctor check this cough.
[cough] Goodbye.
